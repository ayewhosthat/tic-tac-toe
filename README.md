### Overview
Yet another very enjoyable but also at times frustrating project. This really helped me understand the importance of factory functions, and how they keep code organized and clean. Since each piece of functionality is nested within exactly one factory function, this helped me quickly hone in on the code that was giving me bugs.

### Areas for improvement
- Honestly, looks a bit bland, and could use with some re-vamping to make it look more visually appealing. 
- There are several areas where code could have been written without being repetitive and maybe the logic could have been a little bit cleaner. This is because in the console version (see below) I had used a while loop to continuously poll for cells, instead of having the user manually execute playRound() again and again.

### Notes
There are two Javascript files in this repository, main.js and script.js. The main.js file was used for building and testing the console version, and the script.js file was used for building and testing the interactive web version.
